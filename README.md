# Motion Detector
## Python using OpenCV | Pandas

This project is a Motion Detection System built using Python, OpenCV, and Pandas. It captures live video from the webcam, detects motion, and records the time intervals when motion starts and ends. The project uses basic image processing techniques to detect motion and saves the recorded times to a CSV file.
